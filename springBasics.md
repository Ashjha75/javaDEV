### Spring Basics

- Spring is a lightweight, open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java.
- It is one of the most popular frameworks for building web applications, microservices, and RESTful APIs.
- Spring provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
- It promotes good design practices such as modularity, loose coupling, and testability.
- Spring is based on the concept of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI).
- It simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a set of reusable components and abstractions.
- Spring is modular and extensible, allowing developers to use only the components they need.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)

- Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in which the control of object creation and lifecycle is inverted
  from the application code to a container or framework.
- In traditional programming, the application code is responsible for creating and managing objects.
- With IoC, the framework or container is responsible for creating and managing objects, and the application code is
  decoupled from the object creation process.
- IoC allows for better separation of concerns, easier testing, and more flexibility in the application design.
- Spring uses IoC to manage the lifecycle of objects and provide dependencies to the objects that need them.
- IoC is achieved in Spring through the use of the Spring container, which is responsible for creating, configuring, and
  managing objects (beans) in the application.
- The Spring container uses Dependency Injection (DI) to provide the necessary dependencies to the beans.

### Use of IoC in Spring

- The interface `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible
  for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the aforementioned beans.
- In Spring, `ApplicationContext` is the sub-interface of `BeanFactory`. It is a more advanced container
  than `BeanFactory`.
- The `ApplicationContext` container includes all functionality of the `BeanFactory` container, so it is generally
  recommended to use `ApplicationContext` over `BeanFactory`.
- In Spring, we can use many ways to create the `ApplicationContext` container, such
  as `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`, and `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`.

### Configuration of Spring Container

1. **XML-based configuration**: The configuration of the Spring container is done using XML files. The beans are defined
   in the XML file, and the container reads the XML file to create and configure the beans.
2. **Annotation-based configuration**: The configuration of the Spring container is done using annotations. The beans
   are defined in Java classes using annotations, and the container scans the classes to create and configure the beans.
3. **Java-based configuration**: The configuration of the Spring container is done using Java classes. The beans are
   defined in Java classes using Java configuration classes, and the container reads the Java configuration classes to
   create and configure the beans.

### Spring Bean

- A Spring bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC container.
- Beans are the core building blocks of a Spring application and represent the objects that form the backbone of the
  application.
- Beans have these properties:
    - **Class**: The class of the bean, which defines the type of the object.
    - **Scope**: The scope of the bean, which defines the lifecycle of the object.
        - **Singleton**: The bean is a singleton, meaning there is only one instance of the bean in the container. This
          means for different calls of the same bean, there will be only one single reference, and this is the default
          scope of any bean.
        - In singleton bean will be created at the time of container creation means no need to call the getBean() method

        - **Prototype**: The bean is a prototype, meaning a new instance of the bean is created every time it is
          requested.
        - In prototype bean will be created at the time of calling the getBean() method.
    - **Constructor arguments**: The constructor arguments of the bean, which are used to create the object and assign
      values to its properties.
    - **Properties**: The properties of the bean, which are used to configure the object and set its values.
    - **Dependencies**: The dependencies of the bean, which are other beans that the bean depends on.
    - **Lazy initialization**: The lazy initialization of the bean, which determines whether the bean is created when it
      is requested or when the container is started.
    - **Autowiring mode**: The autowiring mode of the bean, which determines how the dependencies of the bean are
      resolved.

### Dependencies in Spring

```text
A typical enterprise application does not consist of a single object (or bean in the Spring parlance). Even the simplest application has a few objects that work together to present what the end-user sees as a coherent application
```

### Dependency Injection (DI)
